            After all the pieces are fried, wipe the pan clean and melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of clarified butter.

            mix in the Khmeli Suneli spice mix if you have it. Lower the heat to medium-low and add the fried chicken 
            pieces. Simmer it for 25 minutes until the chicken is tender and cokked through. If needed, season it with 
            more salt and pepper.
